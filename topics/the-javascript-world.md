# The JavaScript world

I like JavaScript, voil√†.

## Learning resources

My first experience with JavaScript was back in class. At the time, I had the impression it was an old, weird, and ugly language, mainly used for changing the style of HTML elements on the fly or playing funny sounds when the mouse hovered over them. However, it all changed the day I stumbled upon <https://javascript.info/>! I devoured every single chapter of that great course, came out with a solid grasp of JavaScript, and a consequent list of side project ideas that I won't ever ~~finish~~ start. Wow, turns out, the site became big in the JavaScript ecosystem: it's open source and, as of the day, it's has no less than 24k stars on GitHub: <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info>.

Also, for those who want to understand JavaScript more in depth:

- https://eloquentjavascript.net/
- https://www.crockford.com/image/howjsworks.pdf

I read a few chapters of those here and there, and could learn interesting things and get some insight about things I wouldn't even think about in my everyday coder's life.
