# React

I've had some experience with Angular and, to a certain extent, Vue.js in the past, but React is the one I enjoy the most and find the most elegant and logical.

## Great React paid courses

I've only taken the ByteGrad's one, to become quickly proficient with Next.js, which I've started using in my current job, but I must say `The Joy of React` and `React.gg` look compelling to me, who wants to master the subtleties of React as I find it powerful and well designed. Also I've read many positive reviews about them. But honestly I find the [new docs](https://react.dev/) well made and complete.
